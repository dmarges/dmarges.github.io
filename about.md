<h2>About Me</h2>

<!--<p>I absolutely love Programming and have been coding in one form or another since I was 8 years old. I started writing games in BASIC and then later moved on to Assembly and then C++. After graduating College, I saw the rise of the Web and fell in love with developing code for the web. I got my start writing a lot of JavaScript and working on WordPress sites.</p>

<p>Since 2011, I have worked extensively in JavaScript and have a wealth of experience with frameworks like React, Angular and Vue. I also have experience
with frameworks and libraries like Ember, Backbone, and Marionette.</p>

<h2>What I’ve Worked On</h2>

<p>I've worked on dozens of projects, the most visible is my work with the Postmedia Digital Innovation team. I've worked on projects like the Timbits Framework, the Pantry caching library and worked on the architecture that would power the company's entire Mobile App Portfolio.</p>

<p>Through my work on the Innovation team, I also gained experience with D3, SVG, Canvas, and WebGL. On the back-end, I have been working with Node.js for
roughly 6 years.</p>

<h2>I’m Really Good At</h2>

<p>I'm experienced with JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, C++, and Assembly Language</p>

<p>
  I am a total JavaScript ninja. I have spent the last 11 years
  creating Web Applications, Mobile Applications, User Interfaces, Games and
  Open Source Libraries all in JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  I've worked on dozens of projects over the years, the most visible is my work with the
  Postmedia Digital Innovation team. These projects include the
  Timbits Framework, the Pantry caching library, and the JavaScript code architecture
  that was used to develop an entire suite of Mobile Applications.
</p>

<p>
  Through my work on the Innovation team, I also gained experience with D3, SVG,
  Canvas, and WebGL. Last, I gained a sharp and clear insight into the internal
  workings of the browser's rendering engine in order to maximize code performance
  an efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  Over the course of my work with other teams at Postmedia, I have worked on several
  projects in React and Redux on the front end and Node.js and Express on the back end.
