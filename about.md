<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I absolutely love Programming and have been coding in one form or another since I was 8 years old. After graduating, I saw the rise of the Web and fell in love with developing code for the web. I was a PHP programmer working on a lot of WordPress sites and Apps.</p>

<p>Since working in the Web, I've worked extensively in JavaScript and have experience with jQuery, Backbone, Angular.</p>

<p>In 2011, I was introduced to to Ruby and Ruby on Rails and I was smitten! I love working in Ruby and it's the only language I really love working in. I love the Ruby and the Ruby on Rails community and I feel that developing Web Apps in Ruby is what development should be.</p>

<h2>What I’ve Worked On</h2>

<p>I've worked on dozens of projects, the most visible is my work with the Postmedia Digital Innovation team. I've worked on projects like the Timbits Framework, the Pantry caching library and worked on the architecture that would power the company's entire Mobile App Portfolio.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>I've worked on sites like ConnectedCity, the OOSHEW website, and projects like the Cordova Plugin Creator. I've also worked on several open source projects as well.</p>

<h2>I’m Really Good At</h2>

<p>I'm experienced with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
