<div class="portfolio-item">

  <p>
    My Expense Journal is a Web Application that I created with React and Firebase and hosted on Heroku. It came from my
    frustration with other ways of tracking my expenses. I wanted something simple that I could use on my Desktop and on my Phone.

  <p>
    Totem Teardown was a game I made in 24 hours at the 2015 Global Game Jam. I went to the UBC campus and met up with some other
    developers and designers. Not only was it a great bonding experience, it helped drive home the idea that shipping a finished product
    and ruthless scope management are THE keys to a succesful project. We created the game in pure JavaScript.

  <p>
    This is an Infinite Runner game that I created in JavaScript. It was a proof of concept to see how easily I could port the game
    to other platforms. I created builds for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS. The game was very performant across the different platforms.
    The version on this site is the mobile version.

  <p>This game is something I prototyped in a couple of days using my JavaScript Game Engine as well as my Physics Engine.</p>

  <p>
    For a few projects I was working on at the time, I needed an engine that approximated Physics for animations and games. So I created this
    engine called Phys.js and I posted it on Github. This is just an example of two stones (Curling) realistically bouncing off of each other
    with realistic friction and collision.
