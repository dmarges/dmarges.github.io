Not Development related, but I just wanted to draw attention to something that&#8217;s important to me in my little corner of the Interwebs&#8230;

August 19 was Earth Overshoot Day. It&#8217;s a day every year where our demand for natural resources outpaces the Earth&#8217;s ability to renew them.

[Here&#8217;s an article that does a better job of explaining how scientists collect this data and what it means.](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/141916/carter-roberts/on-borrowed-time?cid=rss-rss_xml-on_borrowed_time-000000)
