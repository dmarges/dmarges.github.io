So this is something I&#8217;ve been ranting about for a while and I&#8217;m glad a lot of other people are too.

Many times I have been looking for an App that I heard about from a friend or saw online. I would go to the App Store and search for the app I wanted to download only to not see it in the search results. Let me restate that:

I COULDN&#8217;T FIND AN APP EVEN THOUGH I TYPED THE EXACT NAME OF THE APP!!!

This is incredibly frustrating as an App Developer to have your work virtually unsearchable in the store!

In this article, it looks like the author had similar problems:

I really hope Apple cleans this up as this just further stacks the odds against us developers!
