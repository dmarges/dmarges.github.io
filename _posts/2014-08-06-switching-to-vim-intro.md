Why am I switching to Vim? I mean, Iâ€™ve been an avid user of Sublime Text for a couple of years and I really love it! Well, it has to do with this obsession of mine to be able to do my work exclusively in a browser. I have tried coding and what not through Chrome Dev Tools but found that it had certain limitations especially with saving files. I was discouraged that I might not be able to live out my dream of being a baddass ninja Front End Dev and coding in the browser untilâ€¦wham! A sweet new Chrome Extension dropped which allows you to use your terminal right in your browser. Perfect! Except that doesnâ€™t help my code editing woes. Until I remembered that I watched a video course on something called Vim, which is derived from vi. For those of you who donâ€™t know what vi is, itâ€™s basically an editor that runs in your Terminal. Or I like to describe it as SysAdmin p0rn.

So. Vim. Bam! Except, I have almost no experience with it aside from watching a course about it on TutsPlus. I have used emacs a little, but Iâ€™m told there is an epic, nuclear war between vi and emacs, so something I try not to take sides on. But I soooooooo want to do all of my coding in the browser and try to fulfill my twisted dream of being the Neo of Front End coding.

Thusly, I give you an inside look on my transition to Vim from Sublime Text 2! I will be using it for work and personal projects so hopefully it doesnâ€™t severely drop my productivity such that I am canned ðŸ˜‰
