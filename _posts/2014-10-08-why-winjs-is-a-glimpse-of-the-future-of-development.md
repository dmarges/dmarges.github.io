I read an article on <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/winjs-3-0-shows-industry-shift-towards-javascript/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&#038;utm_medium=email" target="_blank">WinJS</a> and how it represents a shift towards a Ubiquitous JavaScript world. I definitely recommend you check out the article.

If you haven&#8217;t jumped on the JavaScript bandwagon I highly recommend that you do. Even if it doesn&#8217;t become your primary language of choice, you should have a deeper understanding of the language. If you&#8217;re a beginner then just a cursory Google search on getting started will do. If you&#8217;re an Intermediate, I reviewed a book that gets down and dirty with some of the language&#8217;s more advanced concepts. You can find that review <a href="http://www.donmarges.io/scope-and-closures-book-review/" title="Scope and Closures â€“ Book Review" target="_blank">here</a>.

I&#8217;ve touched on this in a [previous post](http://www.donmarges.io/a-great-resource-for-writing-os-x-yosemite-apps-with-javascript/ "A Great Resource For Writing OS X Yosemite Apps With JavaScript"), but JavaScript is fast becoming a truly ubiquitous programming language. With tools like PhoneGap and Titanium, you can build mobile apps with JavaScript. The aforementioned WinJS was built to allow developers to build Windows 8 apps, and now [Apple is allowing you to write desktop apps in JavaScript](http://www.donmarges.io/a-great-resource-for-writing-os-x-yosemite-apps-with-javascript/ "A Great Resource For Writing OS X Yosemite Apps With JavaScript"). In fact, I have been playing around with the Game Development tool Unity and it allows you to script with JavaScript. Even specific to Web Development, there are a ton of front-end frameworks and with Node.js, Full stack JavaScript development is possible. 

I know that JavaScript can be ugly at times, both syntactically and how it works under the hood. But if you combine your JavaScript knowledge with CoffeeScript, I feel that this gives you a nice and easy to read coating around JavaScript.
