I&#8217;ve been coming across a lot of articles lately along the lines of building a Startup every month. Similarly, I have seen posts about building and releasing some software every week. These are not to be confused with Startup Weekends or Hackathons which differ in that the idea is to get something working on the screen and then further developing that idea if it makes sense.

I get the Startup Weekends and Hackathons. They&#8217;re a lot of fun and the purpose is exploratory. But the Startup every month or the shipping software every week thing confuses and somewhat disappoints me. Many times, the authors explain that they are seeing what gets &#8220;traction&#8221; and working on only that which takes off. 

Why this is a problem for me is this just adds to the biggest problem of the Modern Age. Clutter! As a Developer who works with JavaScript, there are dozens of Front-End MVC Frameworks! There are several dozens or probably hundreds of Web-based Project Management Apps! An avalanche of e-mail tools! Enough! 

We need to put a stop to this hyperclutter. This heap of libraries, apps, and frameworks that gets bigger by the day. The biggest problem we face isn&#8217;t scarcity of solutions, it&#8217;s actually being able to discover them.
