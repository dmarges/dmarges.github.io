Oh, I didn’t see you come in… Welcome!

Today is the third and final instalment of my chronicles in switching to Vim. In the past few days, I think that if it wasn’t going to work out for me then it would have been evident. I was able to use it in every situation in both my day job and side projects. I won’t give a recap of every point I could come up with in regards to why I think it’s a great fit for me, but I will just give a couple of highlights that I think you’ll really like.

Split Screen

I can’t tell you how much time this feature alone saved me! I found in many occasions I was editing both a view and a controller and it was infinitely handy to have both in front of me as well as the web app I was working on. Combine this with LiveReload and I was jetting through bug fixes to say the least. The just of it is that you use the :vsplit (vertical) or :hsplit (horizontal) and you get another “window” within Vim. From here you can open a file which is business as usual!

Plugins

The best part of Vim is that you can install plugins which further expand Vim’s goodness. Pathogen is a popular one, but I opted to use Vundler instead. I will spare the precise plugins that I use for my detailed workflow post. I did install the JavaScript syntax and Linter plugins.

Overall, I would definitely recommend you at least try out Vim and see if it’s a good fit for your workflow.

Peace out!
