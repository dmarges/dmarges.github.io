I wanted to post this while I remembered. I had some weird stuff going while trying to post a code sample in a post on my blog. The code wasn&#8217;t wrapped or formatted. I didn&#8217;t think anything of it as I just used WordPress&#8217; built-in &#8216;code&#8217; button that is present in the editor while writing a post. This didn&#8217;t work well because none of the code was indented or formatted. I found that if you wrap the &#8220;code&#8221; tags in a &#8220;pre&#8221; tag then everything looks good!
