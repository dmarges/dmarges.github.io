I read an article on the Verge about Anita Sarkeesian and the horrifically disturbing death-threats she has received recently. What warranted this you might ask? She speaks out against misogyny in Video Games. That&#8217;s right, her only crime was wanting Video Games to not portray women as damsels in distress, sexually objectified, or in any way subordinate to male characters. I have posted a link to the article below, but I want that to sink in for a moment. A woman who is rallying for fair and equal representation of women in VIDEO GAMES received DEATH THREATS and RAPE THREATS. Video Games are a somewhat related or offshoot industry of Software Development and I know this is a huge issue in what we do as well. Please be supportive of Women in our field. It comes down to the golden rule, treat others the way you&#8217;d want to be treated.

Here&#8217;s the article:
