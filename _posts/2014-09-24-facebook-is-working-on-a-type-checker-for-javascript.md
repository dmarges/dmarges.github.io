During Facebook&#8217;s At Scale conference, they [announced](https://lobste.rs/s/fp9ibi?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email) that a Type Checker was in the works for JavaScript. The need for type-checking their JavaScript comes from the fact that bugs are understandably hard to squash when you have a code base that has somewhere in the area of 10 million lines of code or something nuts like that.
