I came across this really awesome looking tool called [Burn](http://k.swd.cc/burn/ "Burn"). I love NES games! I also love the nostalgic games coming out of the Indie Gaming scene. As someone who has started a Mobile Games company in the past and dabbled in Game Development ever since, I always felt that tools fell into two camps: the Drag and Drop tool and the Code Everything Yourself tool.

What I love about this tool is that it is Code it Yourself, but it&#8217;s really a DSL specific to making 8-bit retro games. I&#8217;m going to play around with it and see what I can come up with. Maybe I will post a how-to video or something.
